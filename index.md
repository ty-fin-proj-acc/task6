## Observation and analysis: 

From the tests conducted where each password was run through 3 seperate password checkers, we can understand that the more complex and varied the characters in our passwords, we can understand that the use of various special characters will allow us to be able to increase the complexity of the passwords and ensure that the algorithms used to crack the hashes for these passwords will take an increased amount of time 

There are multiple ways to breach an accound and get its passwords. The most common ways is to infer a list of commonly used passwords and brute force into the account. Some other methods include dictionary attack where an attacker will use a dictionary to get into an account with the help of commonly used phrases and passwords or a rainbow table attack, where an attacker will be able to use hashes that are already cracked to get into the account of a user.

## Summrary 
Overall we can infer the following, the complexity of a password depends on the variation and assortment of the characters used. The more common the word the weaker the password. The inclusion of special characters ensures that the resulatant hash is a unique hash. While making the plain text password falls onto the users, the ability to implement a secured hash algorithm along with features like 'salt' is useful and allows the passwords hash to be far more complex as compared to a regular hash.
